# KafkaStreams
Kafka Streams is a library enabling you to perform per-event processing of records. You can use it to process data as soon as it arrives, versus having to wait for a batch to occur. In this project, I use Kafka Streams to stream some input data as plain-text and process it in real-time. With this, I can count the number of words from our input stream.
